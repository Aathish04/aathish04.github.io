# Hi, I'm Aathish.

I like making stuff - both useful and otherwise.

Here you'll find my thoughts on whatever I'm working on, have worked on, or will work on in the near future.

Like I mentioned in [my very first Hello World Post]({% post_url 2023-12-13-Hello-World %}), I think it's just as important to document _why_ your projects exist as it is to document _how_ they work. Since I work with Technology and Computers, and I'm interested in Cybersecurity, AI, IoT and Automation, you can expect posts on those topics.

I used to write over at [Repperium](https://repperiumsci.blogspot.com), and by that I mean I had literally two articles, and I think I'll enjoy the more markdown oriented editing of Jekyll and Github Pages over the WYSIWYG editor used by Blogspot.

Have an interesting idea you think I should have a look at? You can find my contact information on the contact page [here]({% link contact.md %})
