I've decided to start writing about my projects and ideas, both the ones that I open source and the ones that I keep locked away in some deep dark git remote because of blood contracts and pinky promises. Call me a little strange, but I think it's just as important to document _why_ your projects exist as it is to document _how_ they work. Sure, maybe not everything you make has to have a story beyond "I had a school/college project", but for those that do, I think writing the story down is worthwhile. Who knows, maybe it'll give someone else a great idea and they'll go on to build something awesome.

## [](#expectations)Cool, What can I expect here?

It's a personal blog. Like I said, I'll probably talk about stuff I'm working on.

## [](#specifics)Okay, but what specifically?

Well aren't you curious? I'll write about a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and almost definitely about the █████ and the █████.

In all seriousness, I work with Technology and Computers, and I'm interested in Cybersecurity, AI, IoT and lest this become _too_ generic, I dabble in Automation as well, so expect some words on those.

I have a few projects on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/Aathish04) that I think I could talk about beyond the stuff I've written in each of their README files.

I'm currently writing this when I should be preparing for Finals, so I better get back to that.
